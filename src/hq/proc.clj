;; Concepts
;; ========
;;
;; - Proc -
;; Used to model a subsystem or object. Can be in an 'ok' status or different kinds of fail states.
;; The 'layer' key should be set to an integer and is used for determening the order of rendering,
;; lowest first.
;;
;; - Id -
;; An id is used to keep track of procs and is always a vector with two parts, 'group' and 'index'.
;; An example is [:ai-manager 0] or [:enemy 10].
;; When a new proc is created the index (the integer part) can be specified or automatically
;; generated by setting it to -1.
;;
;; - Handler -
;; The handler is function that is run every time a proc receives a message.
;; You supply your own handler function for every proc you create.
;; A handler function should take two arguments, <proc> and <message>.
;; It should return a (potentially) modified proc.

(def editor {:selected false})

;; Proc members
;;
;; status - :ok :handler-fail :handler-exception :render-fail
;; id - [<group> <index>]
;; layer - integer describing the render layer
;; editor - map of editor related settings
;; channel - the core.async channel where this proc receives messages
;; handler - the function running in an async loop, handling messages and mutating the state of the proc
;; renderfn - a function that runs in the main thread of the app, used for drawing stuff
