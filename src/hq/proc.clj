;; Concepts
;; ========
;;
;; - Proc -
;; Used to model a subsystem or object. Can be in an 'ok' status or different kinds of fail states.
;; The 'layer' key should be set to an integer and is used for determening the order of rendering,
;; lowest first.
;;
;; - Id -
;; An id is used to keep track of procs and is always a vector with two parts, 'group' and 'index'.
;; An example is [:ai-manager 0] or [:enemy 10].
;; When a new proc is created the index (the integer part) can be specified or automatically
;; generated by setting it to -1.
